## Description
The objective of this project is to implement a Bayesian method based on the TrueSkill ranking system to estimate the skill levels of players involved in competitive scenarios. The proposed method will be evaluated using real-world data and compared against alternative approaches.

## Installation
1. Installing requirements
   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Hyperparameters
In this section, you need to set the values for the hyperparameters before running the notebook cells. Here are the key hyperparameters you may need to adjust:

- **parameter_1**: Description of parameter_1.
- **parameter_2**: Description of parameter_2.
- **parameter_3**: Description of parameter_3.

Make sure to review and modify these values in the corresponding cell of the Jupyter Notebook.
